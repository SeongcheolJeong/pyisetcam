- and now also headless `macbethColorError(...)`, with curated Octave parity on `s_metricsMacbethDeltaE.m` covering the default scene/OI/sensor/IP current-matrix workflow, recovered sensor CCM, normalized white-point recovery, per-patch Delta E / LAB outputs, and processed-image RGB summary statistics
- and now also curated Octave parity on `s_metricsSPD.m`, covering the daylight `4000:500:7000 K` comparison sweep for both the D4000-reference and fixed-D65-white-point branches, including the returned angle, CIELAB Delta E, and mired curves
- and now also headless `exposure_value(...)` / `exposureValue(...)`, `photometric_exposure(...)` / `photometricExposure(...)`, and `chart_patch_compare(...)` / `chartPatchCompare(...)`, matching the direct MATLAB exposure/chart helper mini-family used around the older metrics workflows
- and now also curated Octave parity on `t_metricsSQRI.m`, covering the perfect-display SQRI width and luminance sweeps plus the display-MTF replay for `OLED-Samsung-Note3` and `CRT-HP`
- and now also the headless metrics-window helper layer: `metrics_camera(...)` / `metricsCamera(...)`, `metrics_compute(...)` / `metricsCompute(...)`, `metrics_get(...)` / `metricsGet(...)`, `metrics_set(...)` / `metricsSet(...)`, `metrics_description(...)` / `metricsDescription(...)`, `metrics_get_vci_pair(...)` / `metricsGetVciPair(...)`, `metrics_masked_error(...)` / `metricsMaskedError(...)`, `metrics_show_image(...)` / `metricsShowImage(...)`, `metrics_show_metric(...)` / `metricsShowMetric(...)`, `metrics_save_image(...)` / `metricsSaveImage(...)`, `metrics_save_data(...)` / `metricsSaveData(...)`, `metrics_close(...)` / `metricsClose(...)`, `metrics_refresh(...)` / `metricsRefresh(...)`, and `metrics_key_press(...)` / `metricsKeyPress(...)`, matching the older MATLAB metrics GUI helper surface with headless payload returns
- and now also the adjacent metrics ROI/SQRI helpers: `metrics_roi(...)` / `metricsROI(...)`, `metrics_compare_roi(...)` / `metricsCompareROI(...)`, and `ie_sqri(...)` / `ieSQRI(...)`, matching the older MATLAB ROI-picking/Delta-E comparison and Barten SQRI helper surface in headless form while treating the interactive `s_metricsSSIM.m` teaching script as out of scope
- and now also headless `cameraVSNR(...)`, with curated Octave parity on `s_metricsVSNR.m` covering the default camera uniform-field sweep, the stable ROI geometry, normalized VSNR / reciprocal-Delta-E curves across the three light levels, and processed-image RGB summary statistics
- and now also headless `camera_full_reference(...)` / `cameraFullReference(...)` together with the legacy `camera_vsnr_sl(...)` / `cameraVSNR_SL(...)` alias, matching the older MATLAB camera full-reference benchmarking helper on top of the current headless camera/scene/SCIElab stack while treating the GUI-only `cameraWindow.m` and exploratory `cameraMoire.m` workflow as out of scope
- and now also headless `scielabRGB(...)` / `scielab(...)` in a new `scielab.py`, plus MATLAB-style display `rgb2xyz` / `white point` support, with curated Octave parity on `t_metricsScielab.m` covering the `hats.jpg` versus `hatsC.jpg` LCD-Apple tutorial workflow, returned scene geometry, display white point, and the stable S-CIELAB error-map summaries
- and now also curated Octave parity on `s_rgb2scielab.m`, covering the `crt.mat` S-CIELAB script path for `hats.jpg` versus `hatsC.jpg`, including the mean Delta E, the mean/percent above the script’s `Delta E > 2` threshold, scene geometry, display white point, and a normalized error-profile slice
- and now also headless `dac2rgb(...)` / `imageLinearTransform(...)`, with curated Octave parity on `s_scielabExample.m` covering both the script’s `scielabRGB(...)` branch and its explicit `dac2rgb -> displayGet('rgb2xyz') -> imageLinearTransform -> scielab(...)` walkthrough on `hats.jpg` versus `hatsC.jpg`, including the returned scene geometry, white point, mean Delta E summaries, and canonicalized filter/error profiles
- and now also headless `scPrepareFilters(...)` / `sc_prepare_filters(...)`, with curated Octave parity on `s_scielabFilters.m` covering the 101-sample point-spread filters, the 512-sample MTF branch, and the `distribution` / `original` / `hires` Gaussian-parameter variants through normalized center-row and peak summaries
- and now also the legacy SCIELAB helper layer: `changeColorSpace(...)`, `cmatrix(...)`, `gauss(...)`, `getPlanes(...)`, `ieConv2FFT(...)`, `pad4conv(...)`, `preSCIELAB(...)`, `scResize(...)`, `separableConv(...)`, `separableFilters(...)`, and `visualAngle(...)`, matching the older MATLAB preprocessing/filter glue on top of the current headless `scielab.py` implementation
- and now also direct public `ApplyFilters(...)` / `scApplyFilters(...)` aliases on top of the existing `sc_apply_filters(...)` implementation, so the remaining reusable MATLAB SCIELAB filter-application helper names are tracked as covered compatibility surface rather than residual audit debt
- and now also headless `sceneAdd(...)` / `scene_add(...)` plus `sceneGet(..., 'illuminant xyz')`, with curated Octave parity on `s_scielabMTF.m` covering the harmonic `1:32 cpd` sweep, the `remove spatial mean` scene-add path, the returned illuminant XYZ/SPD contract, and the CIELAB versus S-CIELAB Delta E curves
- and now also curated Octave parity on `s_scielabPatches.m`, covering the 7x7 uniform-patch illuminant-perturbation sweep, the returned illuminant XYZ/SPD setup for `sceneCreate('uniform')`, and the paired CIELAB / S-CIELAB Delta E surfaces together with the script’s quantized S-CIELAB summary vector
- and now also curated Octave parity on `s_scielabMasking.m`, covering the fixed `4 cpd` / `0.8` harmonic-mask setup, the `remove spatial mean` target-combination path, the doubled white-point convention from the script, and the returned CIELAB / S-CIELAB target-contrast curves
- and now also headless `colorTransformMatrix(...)` / `scOpponentFilter(...)` / `scComputeSCIELAB(...)` plus `srgb2xyz(...)`, with curated Octave parity on `s_scielabTutorial.m` covering the multispectral Stuffed Animals scene through OI/sensor/IP, the Gray World rendered RGB handoff, the 50 samples-per-degree SCIELAB filter setup, the opponent/filtered-image summaries, and the final SCIELAB LAB output
- and now also curated Octave parity on `s_scielabHarmonicExperiments.m`, covering the sweep-frequency scene through diffuser-blurred OI, gray-world IP rendering, the script’s three opponent-channel scaling branches, and the resulting padded S-CIELAB error-surface summaries

## Status

This repository implements milestone-one scope:

- explicit-object APIs only, no `vcSESSION`
- core scene/display/oi/sensor/ip/camera objects and functions
- upstream asset fetching into `.cache/upstream/isetcam/<sha>/`
- unit tests and a parity harness scaffold

Out of scope for this milestone:

- GUI/App Designer windows
- ray-trace optics
- OpenEXR/MEX integrations
- facetracker, printing, and most peripheral modules

## Quickstart

Install Miniforge and create the environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate isetcam-py
python -m pip install -e .
python tools/fetch_upstream.py
pytest
```

Run the example pipeline:

```bash
python examples/end_to_end.py
python examples/scene_from_file.py
```

Generate the current machine-readable parity summary:

```bash
python tools/parity_report.py
```

Generate the current machine-readable migration gap ledger and audit summary:

```bash
python tools/audit_migration_gap.py
```

This writes a JSON-compatible YAML ledger to
`docs/migration-gap-ledger.yaml` and a summary snapshot to
`reports/migration-gap/latest.json`.
The audit now explicitly folds already-landed low-level demosaic internals,
deprecated image-processing aliases, MATLAB camelcase-to-Python snake_case
wrapper matches, short prefixed MATLAB wrapper names such as `oiGet` /
`oiSet` / `oiAdd`, and GUI-only hooks into covered or out-of-scope
classifications instead of leaving them as false-positive family gaps; it
also now treats the MATLAB OpenEXR MEX shim/build-script family as
out-of-scope integration debt rather than a remaining headless API target,
and it also classifies `sceneFluorescenceChart.m` as out of scope because
the pinned upstream snapshot does not actually vendor the required
`fluorescenceSignal` / `fluorescenceWeights` model helpers. It now also
tracks the legacy display introduction/rendering tutorials and the
`s_displayCompare` / `s_displayReflectanceCtemp` / `s_displaySurfaceReflectance`
script workflows as covered by the existing headless display-scene
regressions, while treating `s_initSO.m` as session-only `vcSESSION`
scaffolding outside the explicit-object migration target. The same audit
pass now also treats the remaining `scripts/development` scratch/tutorial
files as out of scope because they are explicitly unfinished exploratory
workflows rather than stable reusable MATLAB APIs. The adjacent
`scripts/oneoverf` tinker/synthesis notebooks are now also treated as out
of scope for the same reason: they are exploratory spectrum-analysis
scripts, not stable reusable compute surfaces. The image-tutorial audit now
also treats the old standalone JPEG/DCT teaching walkthroughs as out of
scope while tracking `t_ip.m` as covered by the current headless IP
workflow regression surface.

Run the initial metrics helpers:

```python
from pyisetcam import comparison_metrics, metrics_spd

value, params = metrics_spd(spd1, spd2, metric="cielab", wave=wave, return_params=True)
summary = comparison_metrics(reference_image, rendered_image, data_range=1.0)
```

The report includes max-error locations plus edge/interior and 2x2 phase
diagnostics for array outputs, plus case-specific context and
reference-recompute checks for remaining sensor/camera gaps.
For the curated WVF case, the harness also records strict pre-PSF / PSF
stage parity and treats the final Octave delta-PSF convolution as a
documented relaxed `mean_rel` diagnostic, because that path collapses to a
single-precision FFT artifact in Octave.

Regenerate Octave baselines for the curated parity cases:

```bash
python tools/regenerate_parity_baselines.py
```

If the default `octave` wrapper in your environment is broken, point the
tool at a working `octave-cli` binary:

```bash
PYISETCAM_OCTAVE_BIN=/abs/path/to/octave-cli-10.3.0 python tools/regenerate_parity_baselines.py
```

For conda-style Octave installs, the runner now auto-populates
`OCTAVE_HOME`, `OCTAVE_EXEC_HOME`, and `OCTAVE_IMAGE_PATH` from the chosen
binary so baseline export works even when the raw CLI crashes at startup.

## Layout

- `src/pyisetcam/`: package source
- `tools/fetch_upstream.py`: fetch/extract the pinned upstream snapshot
- `tools/octave/`: Octave parity export helpers
- `tests/unit/`: deterministic unit tests
- `tests/parity/`: curated parity case definitions and baseline comparator
- `docs/migration.md`: MATLAB-to-Python name mapping

## Current Expansion

Post-milestone expansion now covers broader scene support and early sensor
preset growth. `scene_from_file` / `sceneFromFile` supports RGB and
monochrome inputs backed by emissive display calibration, the classic test
scene catalog has been expanded with script-driven patterns such as
`harmonic`, `frequency orientation` / `freq orient`, and
`sweep frequency`, `star pattern`, plus script-driven `reflectance chart` support with
explicit sample-list recreation. The first post-milestone `sceneCreate(...)`
expansion slice is now in place too: extra Macbeth illuminant variants
(`d50`, `illc`, `fluorescent`, `ee_ir`, and `custom reflectance`), the
legacy `moire orient` target, and `letter` / `font` scenes now dispatch
through the same headless scene core. The adjacent file-backed constructor
slice is now landed too: `sceneCreate('list'/'scenelist')`,
`sceneCreate('rgb')`, `sceneCreate('multispectral'/'hyperspectral')`, and
`sceneCreate('monochrome'/'unispectral')` now expose the same safe shell
objects the headless `sceneFromFile(...)` path uses before filling in
radiance data; that same shell-constructor lane now also accepts a passed
seed scene in the upstream one-argument forms like `sceneCreate('rgb',
scene)`, `sceneCreate('multispectral', scene)`, and
`sceneCreate('monochrome', scene)` instead of discarding the supplied
scene shell, and both `sceneCreate('empty', wave)` and
`sceneCreate('empty', [], wave)` now replay the legacy wavelength override
instead of forcing the default 400:10:700 grid. The same Macbeth/default
scene dispatcher now also accepts placeholder patch-size slots such as
`sceneCreate('default', [], wave)` and `sceneCreate('macbeth', [], wave)`
without losing the default 16-pixel patch size, while the same Macbeth lane
now also treats empty `surfaceFile` and `blackBorder` slots such as
`sceneCreate('default', 16, wave, [], [])` as the documented defaults
instead of coercing `[]` into a bad asset path. The same scene dispatcher now also accepts MATLAB-style
key/value forms for `sceneCreate('hdr chart', ...)` and
`sceneCreate('hdr image', ...)`, and the same compatibility lane now also
replays MATLAB-style key/value dispatch for `sceneCreate('hdr lights', ...)`
instead of only positional or dict-based Python calls. The adjacent
`scene_create('radiance chart', wave, radiance, ...)` and
`sceneCreate('reflectance chart', ...)` wrappers now accept the same
MATLAB-style key/value arguments too, and the positional
`sceneCreate('reflectance chart', pSize, sSamples, sFiles, wave, grayFlag, sampling)`
form now also honors MATLAB-style empty placeholders for the optional
patch-size, wavelength, gray-strip, and sampling slots. `sceneCreate('bar ee', imageSize,
width)` now replays the documented equal-energy bar alias,
`sceneCreate('squares', imageSize, squareSize, arraySize)` now replays the
documented square-array shorthand, and the slanted-bar dispatcher now also
accepts empty field-of-view placeholders in documented forms like
`sceneCreate('iso12233', imageSize, slope, [], wave, darklevel)`, and
the same scene-size parser now also replays empty size placeholders for the
uniform-family constructors such as `sceneCreate('uniform', [], wave)`,
`sceneCreate('uniform d65', [], wave)`, `sceneCreate('uniform ep', [], wave)`,
and `sceneCreate('uniform bb', [], cTemp, wave)`,
preserving the upstream default `32 x 32` scene size, while
`sceneCreate('uniform monochromatic', sz, wave)` now also replays the
documented size-first shorthand in addition to the existing wave-first form,
and now also honors MATLAB-style empty placeholders in that size-first
shorthand, so `sceneCreate('uniform monochromatic', 12, [])` preserves the
default `500 nm` wavelength and `sceneCreate('uniform monochromatic', [], 550)`
preserves the default `128 x 128` size,
while `sceneCreate('bar', 64, [])` and `sceneCreate('bar ee', 64, [])` now
replay the lower-level helper default bar width of `5` pixels instead of
reusing the wrapper's omitted-argument default of `3`,
while `sceneCreate('point array', 128, 16, [], [], wave)` now replays the
lower-level helper default spectral type `d65` instead of reusing the
wrapper's omitted-argument default of `ep`,
and
`sceneCreate('sweep frequency', [], maxFrequency, [], yContrast)` now
honors MATLAB-style empty placeholders for the size and wavelength slots
instead of crashing on `[]`,
and the same empty-wave placeholder handling now also replays correctly
across the common optional-wave pattern constructors such as
`sceneCreate('line ee', ...)`, `sceneCreate('line ep', ...)`,
`sceneCreate('bar', ...)`, `sceneCreate('bar ee', ...)`,
`sceneCreate('point array', ...)`, `sceneCreate('grid lines', ...)`,
`sceneCreate('checkerboard', ...)`, and `sceneCreate('star pattern', ...)`,
while the same uniform-scene lane now also honors MATLAB-style empty
color-temperature placeholders in `sceneCreate('uniform bb', sceneSize, [], wave)`,
preserving the upstream default `5000 K` blackbody illuminant,
while the same scene-pattern lane now also honors MATLAB-style empty
placeholders in optional positional slots such as
`sceneCreate('line ee', imageSize, [], wave)`,
`sceneCreate('bar', imageSize, [], wave)`,
`sceneCreate('point array', imageSize, spacing, [], [], wave)`,
`sceneCreate('grid lines', imageSize, spacing, [], [], wave)`, and
`sceneCreate('checkerboard', [], nCheckPairs, spectralType, wave)`,
`sceneCreate('checkerboard', checkPeriod, [], spectralType, wave)`, and
`sceneCreate('star pattern', imageSize, [], [], wave)`, reusing the
documented default offset, width, spectral type, thickness, point size, and
line-count values instead of crashing on `[]`,
and the same array-pattern lane now also honors MATLAB-style empty size
placeholders in `sceneCreate('disk array', imageSize, [], arraySize, wave)`
and `sceneCreate('square array', imageSize, [], arraySize, wave)`, preserving
the upstream default disk radius of `128` pixels and square size of `16`
pixels,
while the same helper-backed pattern lane now also honors MATLAB-style empty
placeholders in `sceneCreate('whitenoise', imageSize, [], wave)`,
`sceneCreate('rings rays', [], imageSize, wave)`,
`sceneCreate('rings rays', radialFreq, [], wave)`, and
`sceneCreate('slanted bar', [], [], [], wave, [])`, preserving the upstream
default contrast, radial frequency, image size, slope, field of view, and
dark level instead of crashing on `[]`,
and the same ramp/vernier dispatch lane now also preserves MATLAB's
distinction between omitted arguments and explicit empty placeholders, so
`sceneCreate('ramp', [], [], wave)`, `sceneCreate('linear intensity ramp', [], [], wave)`,
and `sceneCreate('exponential intensity ramp', [], [], wave)` now replay the
helper-level `128 x 128` and `256` dynamic-range defaults, while
`sceneCreate('vernier', [], [], [], [], [])` and
`sceneCreate('vernier', 65, [], [], [], [])` now reuse the lower-level
`sceneVernier(...)` placeholder defaults for size, bar width, and offset
instead of crashing on `[]`,
while the adjacent HDR constructor lane now also replays the upstream
`sceneCreate(...)` defaults for `hdr chart` and `hdr image`, so no-argument
calls match the MATLAB dispatcher’s `10^3.5` / `16` / `12` strip-chart
defaults and `8`-patch HDR-image default, while explicit empty placeholders
in the public wrapper forms reuse the helper-level defaults instead of
crashing,
and
`sceneCreate('moire orient', imageSize, f)` now maps the positional
arguments onto the same headless parameter path as the existing struct-style
moire target form,
and
`sceneCreate('zone plate', imageSize, fieldOfView, wave)` now accepts the
optional field-of-view positional slot while preserving the existing
wave-only shorthand and default `4 deg` behavior,
and
the numeric `sceneCreate('vernier', ...)` shortcut now replays the upstream
MATLAB defaults of `65` pixels, `3`-pixel bars, and `3`-pixel offset instead
of the lower-level helper defaults,
and
the plain `sceneCreate('bar')` shortcut now replays MATLAB's default
3-pixel bar width instead of inheriting the wider helper-level default,
while the documented `sceneCreate('bar ee', ...)` alias now uses the
equal-energy bar spectrum instead of collapsing onto plain `bar`,
while the vendor sensor dispatcher now also unwraps single-entry
MATLAB-style cell/list variant payloads for calls such as
`sensorCreate('MT9V024', [], {'rgbw'})` and
`sensorCreate('ar0132at', [], {'rccc'})` onto the existing vendor preset
builders,
while the custom multispectral sensor lane now preserves the explicit pixel
object and MATLAB-style empty placeholders in
`sensorCreate('custom', pixel, filterPattern, filterFile, [], [])`, so the
default sensor size comes from the CFA pattern and the wavelength grid stays
attached to the provided pixel instead of crashing or falling back to the
default pixel,
and
the `ramp` / `linear intensity ramp` / `exponential intensity ramp`
shortcuts now replay the upstream default `256 x 256` scene size instead of
the smaller helper-era default,
and
the plain `sceneCreate('disk array')` shortcut now replays MATLAB's default
`128`-pixel disk radius instead of the smaller helper-era default,
and
`sceneCreate('letter', 'g', fontSize, fontName, display)` now replays the
documented text shorthand on top of the existing font-object path. The
same scene lane now also accepts the documented `sceneCreate('vernier',
type, params)` shorthand on top of the lower-level
`sceneVernier(scene, type, params)` helper path. It now also preserves the
documented default reflectance-chart sources and sample counts when
MATLAB-style empty placeholders are used in calls like
`sceneCreate('reflectance chart', 24, [], [], wave, [], [])`, instead of
coercing `[]` into invalid `sSamples` or `sFiles` payloads. The same text
shorthand now also honors MATLAB-style empty placeholders in its optional
`fontSize`, `fontName`, and `display` slots, so
`sceneCreate('letter', 'g', [], [], [])` reuses the default Georgia 14 pt
font on `LCD-Apple` instead of crashing or stringifying `[]` into bad
font metadata. The same positional moire-target shorthand now also treats
an empty second argument as “use the default frequency”, so
`sceneCreate('moire orient', imageSize, [])` reuses the helper's default
`f` parameter instead of attempting `float([])`.
The same `sceneCreate('radiance chart', wave, radiance, ...)` wrapper now
also honors MATLAB-style empty placeholders in optional `rowcol`,
`patch size`, and `gray fill` slots for both dict and key/value forms,
reusing the helper defaults instead of attempting `int([])` or passing an
empty layout through to the chart core.
That same `sceneCreate('sweep frequency', size, maxFreq, wave, yContrast)`
wrapper now also honors MATLAB-style empty placeholders in the optional
`maxFreq` slot, so `sceneCreate('sweep frequency', 64, [], [], [])`
reuses the helper default of `size/16` instead of attempting `float([])`.
`sensor_create` now includes generic
`rgbw` / `grbc` / `rccc` presets plus upstream-backed `mt9v024` and `ar0132at`
RGBW/RCCC variants. The next sensorCreate dispatcher slice is now landed
too: `sensorCreate('light field', oi)` and `sensorCreate('light field',
pixel, oi)` reuse the headless light-field helper with MATLAB-style OI
name replay, `sensorCreate('dual pixel', [], oi, nMicrolens)` now mirrors
the upstream OI-sampled split-pixel geometry contract, the documented
multi-variant payloads for `sensorCreate('MT9V024', [], {'rgb','mono','rccc'})`
and `sensorCreate('ar0132at', [], {'rgb','rgbw','rccc'})` now return
tracked sensor lists in the requested order, and direct
`sensorCreate('ovt-large')` / `sensorCreate('ovt-small')` now expose the
existing OVT vendor presets. `sensorCreate('imec44', rowcol)` is now
mirrored by the adjacent camera wrapper too, so `cameraCreate(...)` now
accepts those multi-variant vendor payloads and the `ovt-large` dual-sensor
preset by returning per-sensor camera lists with matching OI, sensor, and IP
objects instead of crashing on list-backed sensor constructors. The same
camera wrapper lane now also accepts `cameraCreate('current')`, reusing the
currently selected session `oi`, `sensor`, and `ip` independently and falling
back to defaults only for the missing pieces. It now also accepts explicit
`cameraCreate('L3', payload)` construction by replaying the supplied L3
payload's `oi` and `design sensor` entries into a headless camera/IP bundle;
the upstream no-argument default `L3defaultcamera` asset branch remains
unsupported because that vendored camera asset is not present in this repo. It
is also routed through the existing IMEC 4x4 multispectral builder, and
`sensorCreate('custom', ...)` / `sensorCreate('fourcolor', ...)` now
reuse the current headless custom filter-pattern helper. The same vendor
lane now also accepts the practical overload
`sensor_create('imx363', 'row col', [rows, cols], ...)` on top of the
already-supported explicit placeholder form.
`sensorCreate('human', params)` plus the explicit
`sensorCreate('human', pixel, params)` form now also replay the upstream
human-cone parameter-struct flow on top of the existing
`pixelCreate('human')` and `sensorCreateConeMosaic(...)` helpers. The same
dispatcher lane now also replays the documented empty-placeholder `[]`
forms for `sensorCreate('imec44', [], rowcol)`,
`sensorCreate('monochrome array', [], N)`, and the `custom` /
`fourcolor` constructors, and it also exposes the legacy
`sensorCreate('Nikon D100')` preset from the vendored Nikon MAT asset. The
dispatcher also now accepts the remaining parenthesized Bayer CFA aliases
from upstream, including `bayer(grbg)`, `bayer(rggb)`, and `bayer(bggr)`.
It also now replays the upstream `sensorCreate('monochrome array', [], N)`
shortcut, including the default 3-sensor case and the practical Python
overload. The scene-constructor lane now also replays the older numeric
`sceneCreate('vernier', sz, width, offset, lineReflectance, backReflectance)`
shortcut on top of the current headless `sceneVernier(...)` object path.
`camera_create(...)` now forwards those expanded
sensor presets too, so camera constructors can directly target `rgbw`,
`rccc`, `mt9v024`, and `ar0132at` sensor variants. The first
metrics/validation slice is also in place:
`metrics_spd`, CIELAB helpers, and generic MAE/RMSE/PSNR utilities.
The same sensor/tutorial wave now also includes headless raw DNG support
through `ie_dng_read` / `ieDNGRead`, `ie_dng_simple_info` /
`ieDNGSimpleInfo`, and `sensor_dng_read` / `sensorDNGRead`, covering the
checked-in Pixel 4a `MCC-centered.dng` workflow from
`t_sensorReadRaw.m` and upstream-backed `sensorCreate('IMX363')` crop
flows. The raw DNG parity case now matches decoded `digital_values`
exactly and checks the rendered RGB result with a bounded normalized-MAE
comparator to absorb the remaining legacy display-gain mismatch between
the Python and Octave render paths. That same tutorial path now also includes headless
`sensor_plot_line` / `sensorPlotLine` coverage for the
`t_sensorSpatialResolution.m` line-profile workflow, including the exact
`sensorSet(..., 'pixel size Constant Fill Factor', ...)` tutorial path and
curated parity on the coarse/fine sensor-vs-OI line data, and headless
`sensor_description` / `sensorDescription` coverage for the
`t_sensorFPN.m` summary path, with curated parity on the returned summary
table fields for the fixed-noise setup used by that tutorial, plus direct
curated parity on the four `noise flag` modes and two-line volts plot used
by the rest of that tutorial, plus ROI-DV summary parity for
`s_sensorPoissonNoise.m`. The same sensor tutorial wave now also
includes `signal_current` / `signalCurrent` coverage for the
`t_sensorInputRefer.m` current-to-electrons workflow, plus
headless `signal_current_density` / `SignalCurrentDensity` and
`spatial_integration` / `spatialIntegration` coverage for the adjacent
legacy sensor-simulation current-density and default grid-integration
helpers, plus direct `analog2digital` / `noiseFPN` / `noiseColumnFPN`
coverage for the same legacy sensor-simulation quantization and fixed-pattern-noise helper surface, plus direct
`sensorRGB2Plane` / `sensorStats` / `sensorCheckArray` coverage for the
adjacent MATLAB CFA-packing, ROI-summary, and CFA-visibility helper
surface, plus
`ie_read_spectra` / `ieReadSpectra` coverage for the core spectral-loading
path used by `t_sensorEstimation.m`, together with curated parity on the
Macbeth/D65/scanner pseudoinverse estimation workflow,
plus direct curated parity on the daylight-basis Macbeth illuminant solve
from `s_sensorMacbethDaylightEstimate.m`,
plus `sensor_color_filter` / `sensorColorFilter`,
`ie_read_color_filter` / `ieReadColorFilter`, and
`ie_save_color_filter` / `ieSaveColorFilter` coverage for the Gaussian
color-filter roundtrip workflow from `s_sensorGaussianFilter.m`,
plus direct curated parity on calibrated `ieReadColorFilter('NikonD100')`
asset loading from `s_sensorPlotColorFilters.m`,
plus direct curated parity on the simulated filter-responsivity and
spectral-filter recovery workflow from `s_sensorSpectralEstimation.m`,
plus headless `sensor_mpe30(...)` / `sensorMPE30(...)`,
`sensor_pd_array(...)` / `sensorPDArray(...)`,
`sensor_jiggle(...)` / `sensorJiggle(...)`, and
`sensor_wb_compute(...)` / `sensorWBCompute(...)` for the remaining
legacy sensor utility helpers built on top of the existing SNR, pixel,
MAT-object load, and sensor-compute paths,
plus headless `bin_noise_fpn(...)` / `binNoiseFPN(...)`,
`bin_noise_column_fpn(...)` / `binNoiseColumnFPN(...)`, and
`bin_noise_read(...)` / `binNoiseRead(...)` for the legacy sensor
binning-noise helpers layered directly on the existing fixed-pattern and
read-noise simulation paths,
plus direct curated parity on the CFA construction workflow from
`s_sensorCFA.m`, including `sensorCreate('ycmy')` and
`sensorSet(..., 'pattern and size', pattern)` behavior,
plus
`filter transmissivities` and overexposed `ipCompute` color-shift coverage
from `t_sensorExposureColor.m`, and `ieFitLine`-driven dark-voltage
estimation coverage for `s_sensorAnalyzeDarkVoltage.m`, plus slope-based
PRNU estimation coverage for `s_sensorSpatialNoisePRNU.m`, plus DSNU
estimation coverage for `s_sensorSpatialNoiseDSNU.m`, plus the
`s_sensorCountingPhotons.m` workflow with MATLAB-style
`sceneCreate('uniform equal photon', [rows cols])`,
`sceneSet(..., 'mean luminance', ...)`, and
`oiGet(..., 'optics aperture diameter', unit)` support, plus headless
`sensor_formats` / `sensorFormats` and `ie_n_to_megapixel` /
`ieN2MegaPixel` coverage for `s_sensorSizeResolution.m`, plus direct
curated parity on the `s_sensorCFA.m` zebra-scene workflow through the
default Bayer, explicit Bayer, YCMY, custom 3x3 RGB, RGBW, and quad-CFA

`wvfGet(..., 'otf')` after the same `ifftshift` relationship used by the

and `oiPlot(...)`, with direct Octave parity on the scalar/image helper
contract used by the upstream diffraction plotting workflows.
That same script-driven WVF surface now also includes the spatial getter
family used by `s_wvfSpatial.m`, including `calc nwave`, `psf sample spacing`,
`ref psf sample interval`, `pupil sample spacing`, `pupil positions`,

That same script-driven WVF surface now also has direct Octave parity on
the scalar control workflow from `s_wvfSpatial.m`, comparing how `npixels`,
`pupil plane size`, and `focal length` change PSF sample spacing and
`um per degree`.
Initial ray-trace optics support is also in place: `oi_create('ray trace')`
loads the pinned upstream Zemax-derived optics asset, and `oi_compute`
applies upstream-backed geometric distortion, relative illumination, and
angle-aware precomputed ray-trace PSFs with cached reuse on repeated
computes, plus MATLAB-style uncropped padding/output bookkeeping and
`oiGet/oiSet` support for ray-trace PSF metadata, including MATLAB-style
`psf struct` normalization, sample angles, image heights, wavelengths, and
optics-name accessors, plus unit-aware raw ray-trace PSF spacing / field
height getters and derived support / frequency axes. Raw ray-trace geometry
and relative-illumination tables are also exposed now, including scalar
ray-trace metadata, unit-aware field-height getters, and MATLAB-style raw
table/function accessors. Raw scalar ray-trace metadata now round-trips
through `oiGet/oiSet` as well, including object-distance aliases and the
legacy `rtcomputespacing` field. MATLAB-style `oiGet/oiSet('optics ...')`
delegation now routes through the same compatibility surface too, and
whole-struct `optics` / `raytrace` replacement now normalizes MATLAB-style
payloads while invalidating stale cached PSFs. Raw ray-trace table fidelity
now also includes MATLAB-style `rtpsfsize` reporting of the underlying 4-D
PSF table, indexed `oiSet` updates for `rtpsfdata` and `rtgeomfunction`,
MATLAB-style raw struct export for `raytrace`, `rtpsf`, `rtgeometry`, and
`rtrelillum`, and MATLAB-style whole-optics export via `oiGet('optics')`
that round-trips through `oiSet('optics', ...)`. The precomputed ray-trace
cache now also exports as MATLAB-style `psfStruct` / `sampledRTpsf`, and
plain `rtpsfsize` now tracks the precomputed PSF kernel size separately
from raw `optics rtpsfsize`. The upstream `rtPSFInterp` helper is also
ported now as `rt_psf_interp` / `rtPSFInterp` for direct interpolation of
raw ray-trace PSFs by field height, angle, and wavelength. The upstream
`rtDIInterp` / `rtRIInterp` helpers are also ported as `rt_di_interp` /
`rtDIInterp` and `rt_ri_interp` / `rtRIInterp`, and the ray-trace geometry
path now routes through those helper ports. The MATLAB helper surface now
also includes `rt_sample_heights` / `rtSampleHeights`, `rt_psf_grid` /
`rtPSFGrid`, and `rt_angle_lut` / `rtAngleLUT`. The staged ray-trace
pipeline is now partially exposed as well through `rt_geometry` /
`rtGeometry`, `rt_precompute_psf` / `rtPrecomputePSF`, and
`rt_precompute_psf_apply` / `rtPrecomputePSFApply`. The legacy
`rt_psf_apply` / `rtPSFApply` name is now exposed too and routes through
that validated cached-PSF path. The MATLAB-style top-level wrapper
`optics_ray_trace` / `opticsRayTrace` is now exposed as the staged
end-to-end ray-trace entry point as well, including cached OI illuminance
bookkeeping. The supporting OI helpers `oi_calculate_illuminance` /
`oiCalculateIlluminance` and `oi_diffuser` / `oiDiffuser` are now public
too, and `opticsRayTrace` routes its blur/illuminance path through them.
That same headless OI utility surface now also includes
`oi_clear_data(...)` / `oiClearData(...)`,
`oi_show_image(...)` / `oiShowImage(...)`, and
`oi_save_image(...)` / `oiSaveImage(...)` for the legacy MATLAB
computed-payload reset, direct RGB render, and PNG-export helpers.

on top of the existing `sceneFromFile(...)` / `sceneAdjustIlluminant(...)`
path.

`oi_illuminant_ss(...)` / `oiIlluminantSS(...)`,

`oiGet/oiSet(..., 'illuminant'/'illuminant photons')` support for the
legacy MATLAB OI illuminant/noise helper mini-family.

`oi_pad_value(...)` / `oiPadValue(...)`, `oi_pad(...)` / `oiPad(...)`,
and `oi_make_even_row_col(...)` / `oiMakeEvenRowCol(...)` for the
legacy MATLAB OI padding and even-dimension helper mini-family.

mini-family.

`oi_depth_edges(...)` / `oiDepthEdges(...)`,
`s3d_render_depth_defocus(...)` / `s3dRenderDepthDefocus(...)`, and

`oi_camera_motion(...)` / `oiCameraMotion(...)`, covering the legacy
MATLAB birefringent anti-alias filter and depth-map-driven camera-motion
burst helpers.

`optics_get(...)` / `opticsGet(...)`, `optics_set(...)` / `opticsSet(...)`,
`optics_clear_data(...)` / `opticsClearData(...)`,
`optics_description(...)` / `opticsDescription(...)`,
`lens_list(...)` / `lensList(...)`, and `optics_to_wvf(...)` /

`optics_dl_compute(...)` / `opticsDLCompute(...)`,
`optics_si_compute(...)` / `opticsSICompute(...)`, and

for the legacy MATLAB optics depth/compute/transmittance wrapper family.

`dl_core(...)` / `dlCore(...)`, `dl_mtf(...)` / `dlMTF(...)`,
`optics_plot_defocus(...)` / `opticsPlotDefocus(...)`,
`optics_plot_off_axis(...)` / `opticsPlotOffAxis(...)`, and
`si_convert_rt_data(...)` / `siConvertRTdata(...)`, covering the
remaining diffraction OTF core/export, defocus-surface, off-axis
falloff, and single-field ray-trace-to-shift-invariant conversion
helpers from the upstream MATLAB optics family.
The audit rules now also recognize short diffraction helper names such as
`dlMTF` as covered compatibility surfaces, while obsolete redirect/index
files like `sceneDepthOverlay.m` and `scripts/metrics/Contents.m` are now
classified out of scope instead of headless API debt.
That same optics helper surface now also includes
`make_combined_otf(...)` / `makeCombinedOtf(...)`,
`make_cmatrix(...)` / `makeCmatrix(...)`, and
`retinal_image(...)` / `retinalImage(...)`, covering the reusable
chromatic-aberration OTF weighting, per-frequency calibration-matrix,
and retinal-strip replay helpers from the older `scripts/optics/chromAb`
workflow while leaving the external `ChromAb.m` launcher and plotting
stub out of scope.
The `rtOTF` groundwork is also starting to land through public helper ports
for `rt_block_center` / `rtBlockCenter`, `rt_extract_block` /
`rtExtractBlock`, `rt_insert_block` / `rtInsertBlock`, and
`rt_choose_block_size` / `rtChooseBlockSize`. An initial public
`rt_otf` / `rtOTF` wrapper is now available as the block-wise ray-trace
OTF path, together with MATLAB-style `rtBlocksPerFieldHeight` control.
The underlying filtered-block support helper is now public too as
`rt_filtered_block_support` / `rtFilteredBlockSupport`.
That same ray-trace helper wave now also includes
`rt_root_path` / `rtRootPath` and the obsolete but still script-visible
`rt_image_rotate` / `rtImageRotate`, and the migration audit now treats
the upstream `rtBlockPartition.m` and `rtImagePSFFieldHeight.m` stubs as
out of scope because they are diagnostic/nonfunctional rather than usable
headless APIs.
`rt_synthetic` / `rtSynthetic` is now available as a synthetic ray-trace
optics generator for testing and controlled local experiments.
That same ray-trace block now also has direct Octave parity on
`s_opticsRTSynthetic.m`, comparing the synthetic geometry and relative
illumination curves, normalized 550 nm center/edge PSF slices, and the
resulting point-array OI summary outputs from the synthetic increasing-Gaussian
ray-trace workflow.
That same ray-trace block now also has direct Octave parity on
`s_opticsRTGridLines.m`, comparing the staged `rtGeometry` /
`rtPrecomputePSF` / `rtPrecomputePSFApply` path against automated
ray-trace and matched diffraction-limited outputs through the returned
gridline image sizes, sampled PSF support metadata, and normalized 550 nm
center-row image slices for the wide-field and reduced-FOV branches.
That same ray-trace block now also has direct Octave parity on
`s_opticsRTPSF.m`, comparing the stored sampled ray-trace PSF metadata,
normalized 550 nm center/edge PSF slices from the computed `sampledRTpsf`
cache, and the rendered point-array ray-trace versus diffraction-limited
image summaries used by the upstream PSF comparison workflow.
That same ray-trace block now also has direct Octave parity on
`s_opticsRTPSFView.m`, comparing the stored sampled ray-trace PSF view
metadata, the normalized 550 nm field-height and angle-sweep PSF rows,
their stable blur-width summaries, and the canonicalized center/edge
`rtPlot(..., 'psf', ...)` row profiles used by the upstream PSF-view
workflow.
The shared MATLAB field-height lookup rule is now exposed too as
`ie_field_height_to_index` / `ieFieldHeight2Index`, and the ray-trace
block-size logic now uses that public helper directly.
The initial Zemax text-import surface is now ported too through
`rt_file_names` / `rtFileNames`, `zemax_read_header` / `zemaxReadHeader`,
`zemax_load` / `zemaxLoad`, and a limited `rt_import_data` /
`rtImportData` path for standard ISETPARAMS + DI/RI/PSF bundles. That
bundle format is now accepted directly by both `rt_import_data(...)` and
`oi_create('ray trace', ...)`, either as the `ISETPARAMS.txt` /
`ISETPARMS.TXT` file itself or as a containing directory, and the
importer now normalizes Windows-style `lensFile` / `baseLensFileName`
paths the way the upstream MATLAB path does. The parameter parser now
also accepts multiline MATLAB vector syntax,
including `...` continuations, bracketed row/column wavelength lists, and
transpose-style vectors such as `[500 600]'`, plus legacy single-line
assignments without trailing semicolons like the older Zemax macros emit
for `baseLensFileName`.
When importing into an existing optics object, `rt_import_data` now also
preserves the existing name/transmittance/compute settings while updating
the top-level ray-trace focal-length / f-number state to the imported
effective values, and it now enforces the upstream `psfSize` evenness
check from the parameter file before loading PSF data. Imported Zemax
bundles now also carry `psfSpacing` through to the ray-trace computation
metadata, so `rtcomputespacing` is populated on imported optics, and an
existing computation spacing is preserved when a bundle omits that field.
Imported ray-trace optics now also retain the requested `rtProgram`
label instead of forcing the lower-case default. Directory-based bundle
loading now also preserves real import failures for malformed Zemax
bundles instead of collapsing them into an unsupported-option error.
Raw MATLAB-style optics structs now also preserve top-level control
fields like `computeMethod`, `offaxis`, and `aberrationScale` through the
import path. When importing into an existing optics object, a distinct
existing ray-trace name is now preserved independently from the top-level
optics name, and a raw `rayTrace.name` now seeds the top-level optics
name when no explicit top-level name is present. Existing
`blocks_per_field_height` settings are now preserved across Zemax
imports too, and raw MATLAB-style ray-trace export now carries
`blocksPerFieldHeight` for round-tripping through `oi_get('optics')`.
Normalized ray-trace key detection now also recognizes
`blocks_per_field_height` directly, plus scalar normalized fields like
`f_number` and `magnification`, keeping raw/normalized struct handling
aligned for those cases too. Partial normalized nested `raytrace`
updates now also merge into the current ray-trace state instead of
dropping existing geometry / PSF tables, and the same preservation now
applies to partial MATLAB-style nested `rayTrace` updates. Raw nested
`rayTrace.fNumber` updates now also override the exported top-level
`fNumber` correctly instead of being clobbered during normalization, and
top-level `focalLength` edits now likewise override the stale exported
nested `rayTrace.effectiveFocalLength`. Whole-optics updates now also
honor normalized top-level aliases like `f_number`, `focal_length_m`,
and `nominal_focal_length_m` in that same export-and-edit workflow, and
raw exported `nominalFocalLength` and `offaxis` now round-trip too.
Whole-optics edits that change only `transmittance.wave` now preserve the
existing scale by interpolation instead of resetting it, and explicit
whole-optics `transmittance.scale` edits now reject wrong-length vectors
the same way the dedicated setter does.
An initial optional `SessionContext` compatibility layer is now in place
too, including session-aware core create/compute entry points and
MATLAB-style helpers for registering and retrieving the current
scene/OI/sensor/IP/camera objects without changing the explicit-object
default workflow. Session-aware `camera_set(...)` and `ip_set(...)`
replacement flows now keep that registry coherent when camera, sensor,
OI, IP, or display objects are swapped out after creation, and the
session layer now also exposes MATLAB-style generic replacement and
listing helpers such as `vcReplaceObject`, `vcReplaceAndSelectObject`,
`vcGetObjects`, `vcGetObjectNames`, and `vcCountObjects`, plus
MATLAB-style pair-return wrappers for `vcGetSelectedObject` /
`vcGetObject`, delete helpers that renumber session slots the MATLAB
way, bulk object-list replacement through `vcSetObjects`, slot-allocation
queries through `vcNewObjectValue`, add-and-select helpers through
`vcAddAndSelectObject`, name generation through `vcNewObjectName`,
batch deletion through `vcDeleteSomeObjects`, nonpositive selected-slot
clearing through `vcSetSelectedObject`, and type reporting through
`vcGetObjectType`. The session layer now also exposes the matching
`ieAddObject` / `ieDeleteObject` / `ieGetObject` /
`ieGetSelectedObject` / `ieReplaceObject` / `ieSelectObject`
wrappers, including nested `optics`, `pixel`, and `ipdisplay`
getter semantics, plus a minimal `ieInitSession` /
`ieSessionGet` / `ieSessionSet` port for session metadata,
preferences, GUI slots, selected-object queries, and
image-size/GPU session flags. Window/figure aliases and
`ieAppGet` are now supported too for the scene/OI/sensor/IP/display
app lookup path, together with the concrete GUI-side aliases that
upstream still reads such as `scene image handle`,
`sensorimagehandle`, `oiwindowHandles`, `vcimagehandles`,
`metricshandles`, `oicomputelist`, and `sensor gamma`. The
session GUI layer now also exposes `vcGetFigure`, `vcSelectFigure`,
and a minimal `ieMainClose` cleanup wrapper over the stored session
windows. Stored window geometry/state compatibility is now exposed too
through `ieWindowsGet` / `ieWindowsSet`, and the adjacent lightweight
GUI/session wrappers `vcEquivalentObjtype`, `vcSetFigureHandles`, and
`ieRefreshWindow` are now available on top of that session state.
Missing session windows now fall back to lightweight headless
placeholders so MATLAB-style `vcSelectFigure(...)` and
`ieRefreshWindow(...)` calls do not fail just because no GUI app has been
created.
The same session compatibility surface now also exposes headless
`iset(...)` / `ISET(...)`, `iset_path(...)` / `isetPath(...)`, and
`iset_root_path(...)` / `isetRootPath(...)`, so the legacy startup and
path-bootstrap helpers resolve the repository root, enumerate recursive
non-VCS subdirectories for optional `sys.path` injection, and initialize a
headless main-window session placeholder without relying on MATLAB GUI
startup.
Name-based lookup is now covered too through `ieEquivalentObjtype` and
`ieFindObjectByName`.
The shared MATLAB-style programming helper `ieParameterOtype` is now
ported too for object-type inference from parameter strings.
Headless `.mat` object persistence is now available through
`vcSaveObject`, `vcExportObject`, and `vcLoadObject` when explicit file
paths are provided.
`iePTable` is now ported in a headless form too, returning structured
parameter-table rows for the core object types without depending on a GUI
table widget.
The adjacent metadata-table helper `ieTableGet` is now ported too, covering
MATLAB-style row/file filtering over headless table-like Python mappings or
row records.
`vcGetROIData` is now ported in a headless form too for scene/OI/sensor/IP
objects, including MATLAB-style rect-to-location conversion, clipped ROI
bounds, XW-style row output, and NaN-filled sensor mosaic planes.
The adjacent headless ROI conversion helpers are now public too:
`ieRect2Locs`, `vcRect2Locs`, `ieRoi2Locs`, `ieLocs2Rect`, and
`ieRect2Vertices`.
The ROI-driven getter surface is now partially ported too: sensor ROI
state plus `sensorGet(..., 'roi volts/electrons/dv')`,
`sensorGet(..., 'roi volts mean')`, `sensorGet(..., 'roi electrons mean')`,
and `ipGet(..., 'roidata'/'roixyz')`, backed by headless
`imageDataXYZ`.
Scene and OI ROI getters are now covered too through
`sceneGet(..., 'roi photons/energy/luminance/reflectance')`,
`sceneGet(..., 'roi mean photons/energy/reflectance')`, and
`oiGet(..., 'roi photons/energy')` plus their ROI-mean variants.
The adjacent sensor compatibility surface now covers direct
`sensorGet(..., 'electrons')` as well as MATLAB-style line-profile
queries through `sensorGet(..., 'hline volts/electrons/dv')` and
`sensorGet(..., 'vline volts/electrons/dv')`, returning per-filter `data`,
`pos`, and `pixPos` vectors.
Sensor ROI/plot compatibility now also includes
`sensorGet(..., 'chromaticity')` and
`sensorGet(..., 'roi chromaticity mean')`, backed by the existing
headless demosaic path.
The adjacent image-processing demosaic surface now also supports
MATLAB-style `ieNearestNeighbor`, `Laplacian`, and
`AdaptiveLaplacian` routing through
`ipSet(..., 'demosaic method', ...)` for RGB Bayer sensors, with the
same bilinear fallback that upstream `Demosaic.m` uses for the
unsupported `gbrg` adaptive-Laplacian branch.
That same headless image-processing surface now also exposes
`demosaic(...)` / `Demosaic(...)`, matching the tutorial-visible
`Demosaic(ip, sensor)` entry point and preferring the current
`ip.data['input']` mosaic when it is present.
That same image-processing surface now also exposes
`faulty_list(...)` / `faultyList(...)`,
`faulty_insert(...)` / `faultyInsert(...)`,
`faulty_nearest_neighbor(...)` / `FaultyNearestNeighbor(...)`, and
`faulty_bilinear(...)` / `FaultyBilinear(...)`, matching the legacy
MATLAB faulty-pixel list, insertion, and GRBG repair helpers.
That same image-processing surface now also exposes
`demosaic_multichannel(...)` / `demosaicMultichannel(...)` and
`pocs(...)` / `Pocs(...)`, matching the remaining MATLAB multichannel
CFA-plane interpolation and sample-preserving POCS demosaic helper
surface on top of the existing Bayer/CFA utilities.
That same image-processing surface now also exposes
`lf_default_val(...)` / `LFDefaultVal(...)`,
`lf_default_field(...)` / `LFDefaultField(...)`,
`lf_convert_to_float(...)` / `LFConvertToFloat(...)`,
`lf_buffer_to_image(...)` / `LFbuffer2image(...)`,
`lf_image_to_buffer(...)` / `LFImage2buffer(...)`,
`lf_buffer_to_sub_aperture_views(...)` / `LFbuffer2SubApertureViews(...)`,
`lf_toolbox_version(...)` / `LFToolboxVersion(...)`, and
`ip_to_lightfield(...)` / `ip2lightfield(...)` for the legacy
Light Field Toolbox utility and IP-export helper family.
That same image-processing surface now also exposes
`lf_filt_shift_sum(...)` / `LFFiltShiftSum(...)`,
`lf_autofocus(...)` / `LFAutofocus(...)`, and
`demosaic_rccc(...)` / `demosaicRCCC(...)`, covering the remaining

state used by `zero level` / `zero`. The neighboring sensor data aliases
now also include `sensorGet/Set('digital value')` and

than volts.

The neighboring pixel material alias surface now also supports direct
sensor-level `refractive index` and `n` access without requiring the
explicit `pixel` prefix.
The adjacent setter semantics now also match MATLAB for
`pixel size same fill factor` / `pixel size constant fill factor`, scaling the

`sensorGet/Set('scene_name')`, `sensorGet/Set('lens')`, and

through `plotSensor(..., 'two lines', True)` on the supported sensor
horizontal/vertical line cases, and headless `plotSensor(...)` now also
accepts MATLAB-style `capture` selection for multi-capture sensor stacks.
The adjacent line/FFT metadata is tighter too: single-line sensor plots now
return plot labels and filter-color metadata, and `plotSensorFFT(...)` now
accepts the same capture selection path for multi-capture stacks.
The remaining histogram/chromaticity wrappers now return the matching
headless plot labels too, including histogram axis labels/filter colors and
the MATLAB-style `rg` chromaticity axis/title strings.

The headless pixel/sensor SNR wrappers now expose the matching plot labels
too, including signal/SNR axis labels, title strings, and legend entries
for the returned component curves.
Multispectral / EXR / reflective-display cases and the rest of the vendor
sensor catalog remain explicitly out of scope until they are ported
deliberately.
The script-driven sensor slice now also covers the headless
`s_sensorMCC.m` workflow: `sensorCreate('bayer (gbrg)')`, headless
`sensorCCM(...)` chart fitting from stored corner points, and the fixed
`ipSet(..., 'conversion method sensor', 'current matrix')` path now all
run end to end with an Octave-backed parity case on the stable CCM and
corrected-render summaries. The adjacent `s_sensorRollingShutter.m`
workflow is now also covered headlessly through `sceneRotate(...)`,
`oiCrop(...)`, and a deterministic rolling-shutter assembly parity case
that compares the temporal sensor trace plus the final assembled render.
The ray-trace helper audit now counts the already-landed data/math wrapper
layer individually instead of holding the entire family at `partial`:
`rtAngleLUT` through `rtSynthetic` are recognized as direct Python
compatibility surfaces, the new headless `rtPSFEdit(...)` port covers the
legacy PSF centering/rotation helper, and the remaining `rtPlot` /
`rtPSFVisualize` movie-window routines are explicitly treated as GUI-only
out-of-scope files.
The small color/metrics cleanup layer now also exposes legacy
`ieColorTransform(...)` on top of the existing sensor-transform math, and
the direct alias wrappers `ieLuminanceFromEnergy(...)`,
`ieLuminanceFromPhotons(...)`, and `iePSNR(...)` are counted as covered
compatibility surfaces. Plot-only stubs like `cameraPlot.m` and
`psfPlotrange.m` are now classified as GUI-only out of scope.
The remaining `tutorials/color` audit tail is closed too: the
chromaticity and energy/quanta walkthroughs are now tracked as covered
workflow evidence through focused headless regressions, while
`t_colorSpectrum.m` remains backed by curated parity.
The `tutorials/code` tail is closed as well: the deprecated rendering
walkthrough is now backed by a focused headless regression, the
`vcSESSION` object-database tutorials are counted against the existing
session compatibility layer, and the old `startup.m` path-management note
is explicitly out of scope.
The `tutorials/camera` family is now closed too: the camera introduction,
noise, anti-alias, and full system walkthroughs are tracked through
focused headless camera regressions plus a small diffuser fix that now
replays blur and birefringent anti-alias filters through non-raytrace
`oi_compute(...)`.
The `tutorials/printing` tail is now closed too: the halftoning walkthrough
is backed by direct `HalfToneImage(...)` and `FloydSteinberg(...)`
compatibility wrappers plus a focused printing tutorial regression over
clustered-dot, Bayer, and error-diffusion output.
The tiny `scripts/data` / `scripts/faces` tail is now cleaned up too: the
scratch-data bootstrap script is covered by a focused headless
`scene -> oi -> sensor -> ip` initialization regression, while the face
detection demo is explicitly out of scope because the vendored upstream file
immediately returns and depends on MATLAB Vision Toolbox UI behavior.
The small `utility/file` helper tail is cleaner too: headless wrappers now
cover `ieImageType(...)`, `ieSaveSpectralFile(...)`, `ieTempfile(...)`,
`ieVarInFile(...)`, `pathToLinux(...)`, `vcImportObject(...)`,
`vcReadSpectra(...)`, and `vcSaveMultiSpectralImage(...)`, while the pure
MATLAB file-picker helpers `ieReadMultipleFileNames.m`,
`vcSelectDataFile.m`, and `vcSelectImage.m` are explicitly tracked as GUI
out of scope rather than residual headless debt.
That same compatibility layer now also covers `ieWebGet(...)`,
`ieXL2ColorFilter(...)`, and `vcReadImage(...)`: `ieWebGet(...)` stays
headless by returning list or browse metadata plus local download or unzip
results without opening a browser, the spreadsheet importer now supports CSV
plus simple XLSX color-filter and spectral payloads, and the image reader
replays legacy RGB and basis-coded multispectral contracts on top of
`sceneFromFile(...)`.
That `utility/file` family is now fully closed: direct wrappers also cover
`ieDNGRead(...)`, `ieDNGSimpleInfo(...)`, `ieReadColorFilter(...)`,
`ieReadSpectra(...)`, `ieSCP(...)`, `ieSaveColorFilter(...)`,
`ieSaveMultiSpectralImage(...)`, `ieSaveSIDataFile(...)`, `vcExportObject(...)`,
`vcLoadObject(...)`, and `vcSaveObject(...)`.
The neighboring `utility/plots` gateway slice is cleaner too:
`plotDisplaySPD(...)`, `plotDisplayLine(...)`, `plotDisplayColor(...)`,
`plotDisplayGamut(...)`, and `plotSensorHist(...)` now have direct headless
wrapper coverage in `pyisetcam.plotting`, and the legacy alias entry points
`plotOI(...)`, `scenePlot(...)`, and `sensorPlot(...)` are exported directly
on top of the existing headless plotting gateways.
That same plotting family now also covers the small axis-annotation helpers
`identityLine(...)`, `xaxisLine(...)`, `yaxisLine(...)`, and
`plotTextString(...)` through direct headless wrappers that return the line
geometry, text placement, and styling payloads instead of MATLAB figure
handles.
The next standalone plotting helpers are covered too:
`plotGaussianSpectrum(...)`, `plotSpectrumLocus(...)`,
`plotContrastHistogram(...)`, and `plotEtendueRatio(...)` now return the
same core spectral, chromaticity, histogram, and etendue payloads
headlessly instead of opening MATLAB graph windows.
The adjacent standalone plotting helpers are cleaner too:
`iePlaneFromVectors(...)`, `iePlotJitter(...)`, `plotNormal(...)`,
`plotRadiance(...)`, and `plotReflectance(...)` now return the same plane,
jitter, PDF, and wavelength-line payloads headlessly instead of opening
MATLAB figure windows.
That same sensor plotting family now also exposes the direct MATLAB entry
points `plotPixelSNR(...)`, `plotSensorEtendue(...)`, and
`plotSensorSNR(...)` on top of the existing `plotSensor(...)` payloads.
The adjacent figure-style plotting helpers are cleaner too:
`fisePlotDefaults(...)`, `ieFigureFormat(...)`, `ieFigureResize(...)`,
`iePlot(...)`, `iePlotSet(...)`, `iePlotShadeBackground(...)`, and
`ieShape(...)` now return the same graphics-default, figure-layout, line,
background-patch, and analytic-shape payloads headlessly instead of
opening or mutating MATLAB figure windows.
The neighboring density/helper plotting slice is smaller too:
`hist2d(...)`, `scatplot(...)`, `ieHistImage(...)`, and
`plotSetUpWindow(...)` now return the same histogram-count, scatter-density,
histogram-image, and graph-window-default payloads headlessly instead of
opening MATLAB figures.
That same `utility/plots` family now also covers the last direct plotting
tail: `plotML(...)`, `plotMetrics(...)`, and `sensorPlotColor(...)` now have
direct headless compatibility wrappers in `pyisetcam.plotting`, returning
microlens irradiance/offset meshes, metrics-ROI histogram summaries, and
demosaiced channel-scatter payloads plus blackbody reference loci. The
legacy `plotSceneTest.m` and `plotSensorTest.m` workflows are now tracked
against focused plotting regressions instead of remaining as anonymous open
audit debt.
The adjacent `utility/image` numeric helper tail is shrinking too:
`ieFindWaveIndex(...)`, `ieWave2Index(...)`, `ieRadialMatrix(...)`,
`imageBoundingBox(...)`, `imageCentroid(...)`, `imageCircular(...)`, and
`imageContrast(...)` now have direct headless compatibility wrappers in
`pyisetcam.utils` with focused regressions over MATLAB-style 1-based
indexing, radial support, centered aperture masking, centroid rounding, and
per-channel contrast normalization.
That `utility/image` family is now fully closed too: the remaining direct
surface is covered by `ie_field_height_to_index(...)` /
`ieFieldHeight2Index(...)` in `pyisetcam.optics` plus the new
`image_dead_leaves(...)` / `imageDeadLeaves(...)` and
`image_vernier(...)` / `imageVernier(...)` wrappers in `pyisetcam.scene`.
The adjacent `data/sensor` family is now cleaned up too: the vendored sensor
asset bundle is counted directly against the current `AssetStore` and
sensor-model runtime coverage, while the old MATLAB asset-authoring scripts
that generated those MAT or TIFF files are explicitly treated as provenance
notebooks outside the headless migration target.
The neighboring `data/human` family is now cleaned up the same way: the
vendored human spectral assets are counted directly against the current
`AssetStore` readers plus the XYZ, luminosity, rods, Stockman, and macular
runtime coverage, while the old MATLAB creator notebooks and plotting
artifacts are explicitly treated as provenance assets outside the headless
migration target.
The adjacent `data/lights` family is now cleaned up the same way as well:
the vendored illuminant bundle is counted directly against the current
`AssetStore`, daylight generation, illuminant creation, scene illuminant
adjustment, and Gretag or daylight regression coverage, while the MATLAB
data-import and comparison notebooks that authored those MAT files are
explicitly treated as provenance assets outside the headless migration
target.
The neighboring `data/lens` family is now cleaned up in the same style:
the vendored lens JSON bundle is counted directly against the current
`lensList(...)` and ray-trace optics import coverage, while the MATLAB
focus-table and metadata-maintenance notebooks around those lens files are
explicitly treated as provenance or analysis assets outside the headless
migration target.
The adjacent `data/optics` family is now cleaned up the same way too: the
vendored optics bundle is counted directly against the current ray-trace
loaders, flare assets, and Thibos virtual-eye coverage, while the old
`VirtualEyesDemo.m` plotting script is explicitly treated as a provenance
demo outside the headless migration target.
The tiny `data/fluorescence` bundle is now explicitly tracked as out of
scope: the pinned upstream snapshot only vendors fluorophore MAT assets,
while the required fluorescence-model helpers live outside the supported
ISETCam migration target.
The adjacent `data/safetystandards` bundle is now counted directly too:
the vendored hazard spectra are already exercised by the current
`humanUVSafety(...)` path, while the old MATLAB EN62471 transcription
notebook that produced those MAT files is explicitly treated as provenance
outside the headless migration target.
The neighboring `data/images` bundle is now counted directly too: the
vendored RGB, raw, and multispectral image assets are already exercised
through the current `sceneFromFile(...)`, raw-image import, and camera or
parity workflows, while the old spectral-face download notebook is
explicitly treated as a provenance demo outside the headless migration
target.
The adjacent `data/surfaces` bundle is now counted directly too: the
vendored reflectance and chart assets are already exercised through the
current `surfaceReflectance(...)`, `sceneCreate(...)`, Esser-chart, skin,
and curated `s_surfaceMunsell.m` parity workflows, while the old Esser and
hemoglobin authoring notebooks are explicitly treated as provenance data
generation outside the headless migration target.
The neighboring `data/scenes` family is now explicitly tracked as out of
scope: the pinned upstream snapshot does not vendor reusable scene assets
there at all, only an empty placeholder plus the old `d_sceneICVL.m`
local-path ingest notebook for the external ICVL repository.
The adjacent `data/displays` bundle is now counted directly too: the
vendored CRT, LCD, OLED, and reflectance display calibrations are already
exercised through `displayCreate(...)` plus scene or IP display-backed
workflows, `render_oled_samsung(...)` and `render_lcd_samsung_rgbw(...)`
now exist as direct headless wrappers for the Samsung dixel helpers, and
the old `ieBarcoSign.m` calibration-authoring notebook is explicitly
treated as provenance outside the headless migration target.
The tiny `data/microlens` and `data/validation` bundles are now explicitly
tracked as out of scope too: the former only vendors standalone microlens
design JSON presets that the current analytic microlens workflow does not
import, and the latter only vendors archived MATLAB validation payloads
rather than runtime assets or headless APIs.
The neighboring `fonts` and `data/fonts` pair are now covered together:
`fontBitmapGet(...)`, `fontCreate(...)`, `fontGet(...)`, `fontSet(...)`,
and `sceneFromFont(...)` now exist as direct headless wrappers, and the
vendored Georgia glyph bitmaps are exercised directly as the runtime font
cache rather than left as standalone asset debt.
That same utility-image slice now also covers `ieCmap(...)`,
`ieCropRect(...)`, `ieLUTDigital(...)`, `ieLUTInvert(...)`, and
`ieLUTLinear(...)`, with direct regressions for the simple MATLAB color-map
forms, field-of-view crop-rectangle math, and forward/inverse gamma-table
lookup behavior.
The adjacent resampling/geometry utility tail is smaller too:
`rgb2dac(...)`, `imageTranspose(...)`, `imageTranslate(...)`,
`imageInterpolate(...)`, and `imageHparams(...)` now have direct headless
compatibility wrappers in `pyisetcam.utils`, with focused regressions over
DAC lookup-table mapping, per-plane transpose, MATLAB-style left/up
translation, bilinear resize shape/corner behavior, and the default
harmonic-parameter structure.
The remaining utility-image harmonic/montage tail is smaller now too:
`imageGabor(...)`, `imageMakeMontage(...)`, and `imageMontage(...)` now
have direct headless compatibility wrappers in `pyisetcam.utils`, while
`imageShowImage(...)` is covered by a headless IP-render wrapper in
`pyisetcam.ip`; the GUIDE-only `imageSetHarmonic.m` dialog is explicitly
tracked as out of scope.
That same utility-image display/spectral slice is smaller now as well:
`convolvecirc(...)`, `imageSlantedEdge(...)`, `imageSPD(...)`,
`imageSPD2RGB(...)`, `imagehc2rgb(...)`, `imagescRGB(...)`,
`imagescOPP(...)`, and `imagescM(...)` now have direct headless
compatibility wrappers in `pyisetcam.utils`, while the local PNG report
generator `ieMontages.m` and the session/window browser `imageMultiview.m`
are explicitly treated as out of scope.
The legacy startup/path trio is now covered too: `ISET.m`, `isetPath.m`,
and `isetRootPath.m` are tracked against the optional headless session
bootstrap wrappers `iset(...)`, `isetPath(...)`, and `isetRootPath(...)`
rather than remaining as anonymous top-level audit debt.
The adjacent `main` family is closed too: `ieInitSession(...)`,
`ieMainClose(...)`, `ieSessionGet(...)`, and `ieSessionSet(...)` are now
counted directly as ported headless session wrappers, while
`ieMainW(...)`, `iePrintSessionInfo(...)`, and `mainOpen(...)` now have
explicit compatibility wrappers in `pyisetcam.session` for main-window
placeholder bootstrapping, session-summary text output, and headless
GUI-state bookkeeping.
The neighboring `human` helper slice is smaller now too:
`humanPupilSize(...)`, `watsonImpulseResponse(...)`,
`watsonRGCSpacing(...)`, `kellySpaceTime(...)`,
`poirsonSpatioChromatic(...)`, `westheimerLSF(...)`,
`humanSpaceTime(...)`, `humanAchromaticOTF(...)`, `humanCore(...)`,
`humanOTF(...)`, `humanLSF(...)`, and `ijspeert(...)` now have direct
headless compatibility wrappers across `pyisetcam.metrics` and
`pyisetcam.optics`, with focused regressions covering pupil-size models,
temporal impulse normalization, Kelly/Poirson dispatch, Westheimer line
spread, human OTF/LSF payloads, and IJspeert MTF/PSF/LSF replay.
That same `human` family now also covers the neighboring cone/macular
helpers: `humanOpticalDensity(...)`, `humanConeContrast(...)`,
`humanConeIsolating(...)`, `humanMacularTransmittance(...)`, and
`humanOTF_ibio(...)` now have direct headless compatibility wrappers, with
focused regressions over Stockman density defaults, energy/quanta cone
contrast equivalence, display cone-isolating directions, macular
transmittance updates on OIs, and the ISETBio `ifftshift` OTF storage
contract.
That same `human` family is now fully closed too: the deprecated
`humanOI(...)` retinal-irradiance path is replayed through a thin
headless wrapper over the existing OI compute stack, `humanUVSafety(...)`
now covers the actinic/eye/blue-hazard and thermal threshold calculations
against the vendored safety-standard spectra, and `ieConePlot(...)`
returns the cone-grid and blurred RGB mosaic payload headlessly instead of
opening a MATLAB figure window.
The adjacent `scripts/human` family is closed too: the Brettel
color-blind workflow is now covered by direct `xyz2lms(..., cbType,
whiteXYZ)` regression coverage, the display-point-spread script is backed
by a headless `display -> scene -> wvf OI -> cone mosaic sensor`
regression, the lamp-safety scripts are counted against the existing
`humanUVSafety(...)` / radiance-conversion coverage, and the deprecated or
ISETBio-gated human notebooks are explicitly treated as out of scope.
The adjacent `scripts/image` family is closed too: the remaining
headless IP workflows are now counted directly against the current
`ieN2MegaPixel(...)`, `imagehc2rgb(...)`, `imageSensorConversion(...)`,
`imageIlluminantCorrection(...)`, and sRGB roundtrip regression surface,
while the old standalone JPEG/DCT classroom helpers plus the GUI-heavy
exploratory image scripts are explicitly treated as out of scope.
The small `web` family is now closed too: `webData`, `webFlickr`,
`webLOC`, `webPixabay`, and `webCreateThumbnails(...)` now have direct
headless compatibility coverage for catalog search, remote image fetch,
scene replay, and local thumbnail generation, while the scratch
`dngImport.m` notebook is explicitly treated as out of scope because the
supported DNG runtime path already lives under `ieDNGRead(...)`.
The neighboring `cp` family is now closed as audit-only scope: the
remaining `cpCamera`, `cpScene`, `cpCModule`, burst-IP, and demo-script
entries are all prototype computational-photography wrappers built around
external ISET3d or PBRT recipe rendering, MATLAB video export, or toolbox
registration workflows rather than supported standalone pyisetcam runtime
surfaces.
The broad `utility` family is smaller too: the `utility/list` catalog
helpers `ieDataList(...)`, `ieLightList(...)`, and
`ieReflectanceList(...)` now have direct headless compatibility wrappers
in `pyisetcam.utils`, and the neighboring `utility/units` slice now also
covers `dpi2mperdot(...)`, `ieDpi2Mperdot(...)`, `ieN2MegaPixel(...)`,
`ieSpace2Amp(...)`, `ieUnitScaleFactor(...)`, `sample2space(...)`, and
`space2sample(...)`, including the MATLAB default-microns scaling,
truncated mean-to-Nyquist FFT support, centered sample geometry, and the
obsolete zero-based inverse-spacing contract.
That same broad `utility` family is smaller again: the adjacent
`utility/numerical` helper slice now also covers
`getMiddleMatrix(...)`, `ieClip(...)`, `ieHwhm2SD(...)`, `ieScale(...)`,
`ieScaleColumns(...)`, `ieCXcorr(...)`, `ieFitLine(...)`, `isodd(...)`,
`rotationMatrix3d(...)`, `unpadarray(...)`, `upperQuad2FullMatrix(...)`,
and `vectorLength(...)`, with direct headless wrappers for centered
matrix extraction, bounded clipping/scaling, Gaussian-width conversion,
rotation matrices, quadrant mirroring, and NaN-tolerant vector norms.
That same `utility/numerical` family is now closed too: the remaining
tail is covered by direct headless wrappers for `ffndgrid(...)`,
`ieCompressData(...)`, `ieLineAlign(...)`, `ieTikhonov(...)`, and
`qinterp2(...)`, which handle uneven-sample gridding, uint16/uint32 data
compression, shift-and-scale line alignment, ridge-plus-smoothness
regularization, and nearest/triangular/bilinear 2-D interpolation
without relying on MATLAB figures or toolbox state.
The neighboring `utility/statistics` family is now closed too: direct
headless wrappers now cover `biNormal(...)`, `expRand(...)`,
`gammaPDF(...)`, `getGaussian(...)`, `ieExprnd(...)`, `ieMvnrnd(...)`,
`ieNormpdf(...)`, `ieOneOverF(...)`, `iePoisson(...)`, `iePrcomp(...)`,
`iePrctile(...)`, `lorentzSum(...)`, `ieFractalDrawgrid(...)`, and
`ieFractaldim(...)`, including separable bivariate Gaussians, RF-support
Gaussian normalization, deterministic exponential and multivariate-normal
sampling, percentile fallback interpolation, radial 1/f spectra,
box-count fractal slopes, and magenta grid overlays without opening
MATLAB figures.
The adjacent `utility/hypercube` family is now closed too: direct
headless wrappers now cover `hcBlur(...)`, `hcIlluminantScale(...)`,
`hcReadHyspex(...)`, `hcReadHyspexImginfo(...)`, `hcViewer(...)`,
`hcimage(...)`, `hcimageCrop(...)`, and `hcimageRotateClip(...)`,
including ENVI header parsing and band-subset replay, per-plane Gaussian
blur, illuminant scale-map estimation, headless mean-gray/montage/movie
payloads, rect-based hypercube cropping, and percentile-clipped
rotation. The external ReDFISh notebook is explicitly treated as out of
scope.
The neighboring `utility/dll70` family is now closed as audit-only scope:
the remaining entries are deployment-era MATLAB MEX path selectors,
compiler helpers, Visual C++ redistribution installers, and host
MAC-address or licensing probes rather than supported standalone
pyisetcam runtime surfaces.
The adjacent `utility/gif` family is now closed as audit-only scope too:
the remaining files are generic MATLAB GIF or figure-export helpers built
around `imwrite`, `getframe`, `export_fig`, or `exportgraphics`, while the
supported pyisetcam runtime already handles object-pipeline GIF export
through higher-level headless video paths.
The neighboring `utility/xml` family is now closed too: direct headless
wrappers now cover `ieXML2struct(...)` / `xml2struct(...)` and
`ieStruct2XML(...)` / `struct2xml(...)`, including MATLAB-style
`_dash_`, `_colon_`, and `_dot_` field-name escaping, repeated-element
list replay, XML-string or file parsing, and `.xml` extension fallback on
save/load without any Java or MATLAB DOM dependencies.
The adjacent `utility/publish` family is now closed as audit-only scope:
the remaining files are MATLAB batch `publish(...)` notebooks for
generating local HTML or PDF artifacts from script and tutorial
directories, which is documentation-build behavior rather than a
supported pyisetcam runtime API.
The neighboring `utility/video` family is now closed as audit-only scope
too: the remaining `ieMovie.m` helper is a generic MATLAB figure/video
writer built around `imagesc`, `drawnow`, `getframe`, and `VideoWriter`,
while the supported pyisetcam runtime already handles object-pipeline
animation through higher-level headless helpers such as
`scene_make_video(...)` and `oi_preview_video(...)`.
That same top-level utility helper tail is now fully closed too: direct
headless wrappers now cover `ieFindFiles(...)`, `ieTone(...)`,
`ieUncompressData(...)`, `ieInit(...)`, and `ieRadiance2IP(...)`. The
browser-only `ieManualViewer.m` and ridge-regression notebook
`ieTikhonovRidge.m` are explicitly treated as out of scope, so the
remaining utility debt is now concentrated in the broader
`utility/programming` and `utility/external` families instead of the
standalone top-level helpers. Inside `utility/external`, the vendored
`JSONio` package is now explicitly tracked as out of scope because it is a
generic third-party MATLAB JSON integration layer rather than an ISETCam
runtime surface. The neighboring `dcraw` package is tracked the same way:
it is only MATLAB glue around external platform-specific `dcraw`
executables plus a demo script, while pyisetcam keeps direct headless
coverage only for the checked-in DNG path via `ie_dng_read(...)` and
`sensor_dng_read(...)`. The smaller `AddTextToImage` package is now
covered directly instead: `BitmapFont(...)`, `RasterizeText(...)`,
`AddTextToImage(...)`, and `AddTextToImageWithBorder(...)` all have
headless compatibility wrappers in `pyisetcam.fonts`, while the two demo
scripts remain out of scope. The next tier of tiny one-off external
helpers is now tracked as out of scope too: `ImageConvFrequencyDomain.m`,
`arrow3.m`, `bluewhitered.m`, `cprintf.m`, `cpuinfo.m`, and
`insertInImage.m` are generic third-party plotting, host-diagnostics, or
figure-annotation utilities rather than supported pyisetcam runtime
surfaces. The neighboring micro-packages are smaller too: the vendored
`DataHash_20190519` package and the GUI-only `fstack` preview or demo
files are explicitly out of scope, while `exiftoolInfo(...)`,
`exiftoolDepthFromFile(...)`, `max2(...)`, and `min2(...)` now have direct
headless compatibility coverage in the current runtime. The next tier is
smaller too: `comp_struct(...)`, `list_struct(...)`, `zernfun(...)`,
`zernfun2(...)`, and `zernpol(...)` now have direct headless compatibility
wrappers in `pyisetcam.utils`, while the third-party `Inpaint_nans`
numerical package and the GUI-only `freezeColors` figure helpers are
explicitly treated as out of scope.
The neighboring `utility/programming` family is now fully closed too:
direct headless compatibility coverage now explicitly tracks
`appendStruct(...)`, `cellDelete(...)`, `cellMerge(...)`, `checkfields(...)`,
`compareFields(...)`, `gatherStruct(...)`, `ieContains(...)`,
`replaceNaN(...)`, `struct2pairs(...)`, `ieStructCompare(...)`,
`ieStructRemoveEmptyField(...)`, `ieHash(...)`, and the broader `vc*` /
`ie*` session-object helper surface against the current
`pyisetcam.utils`, `pyisetcam.session`, and `pyisetcam.ptable` runtime.
The remaining environment-only helpers such as `checkToolbox.m`,
`clx.m`, `hiddenHandle.m`, `ieFindCallback.m`, `ieMemoryCheck.m`,
`ieMemorySize.m`, `ieQuestdlg.m`, and `notDefined.m` remain explicitly
tracked as out of scope. The last large external utility lane, the
vendored Oxford VGG facetracker package, is now explicitly treated as
out of scope too because it is a standalone ffmpeg or `VideoReader`,
`classdef`, `parfor`, pretrained-model, and MEX-backed video-processing
stack rather than a supported pyisetcam runtime surface.
The adjacent `utility/external/hdr` lane is now fully closed too:
`build_pyramid(...)`, `recons_pyramid(...)`, the Haar/QMF builders and
reconstructors, `pad_reflect(...)`, `pad_reflect_neg(...)`,
`modulateFlip(...)`, `imNorm(...)`, `finalTouch(...)`, `getPFMraw(...)`,
and `rangeCompressionLum(...)` now have direct headless compatibility
coverage in `pyisetcam.scene`, with focused regressions over padding
replay, Haar/QMF reconstruction, normalization, and PFM channel packing.
The remaining steerable-pyramid files in the vendored HDR package are now
explicitly tracked as out of scope because the upstream README requires
Eero Simoncelli's external MatlabPyrTools toolbox for that branch, and
the pinned ISETCam snapshot does not vendor the required helpers such as
`rcosFn`, `pointOp`, `steer2HarmMtx`, or `pyrBand`. With the facetracker
package also closed as external-toolbox scope, the pinned migration-gap
ledger is now fully closed at `703` parity entries, `328` ported
wrappers, and `412` out-of-scope paths, with no remaining open audit
entries.
